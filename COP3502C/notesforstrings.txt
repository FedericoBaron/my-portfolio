//null sentinel????? null terminator is at the end of char array aka string. '\0'

// string literal is name = "sean " 
// string literals are read only
//use strcpy instead 
//string.h is only used when u have string functions b
// use strcmp instead of using if(str1 == str2) because you're comparing memory addresses with == in c for strings. if strcmp == 0 checks if they're equal. returns 0 if theyre equal
